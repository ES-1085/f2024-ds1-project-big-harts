## Summary

The Rozalia Project is a non-profit based in the Northeast working to protect and clean the world's oceans and waterways through remediation, education, and solutions-based research. In the summer months, much of their work is done in the Gulf of Maine out of a 60ft research vessel, the American Promise. The boat hosts volunteers and researchers who work to tackle ongoing removal efforts of marine debris on islands in Maine, much of which can be sourced back to the fishing industry in Maine. 

On August 24th, 2024, the Rozalia Project partnered with the Maine Island Trails Association,
US-Fish and Wildlife, and volunteers, to remove abandoned and derelict fishing gear on Hart Island. The island is a small rugged spit of uninhabited land about a mile offshore and Southwest of Port Clyde, ME. It is a refuge for nesting seabirds despite the large presence of lost, abandoned, and dumped fishing gear. 

In 2023, the Rozalia Project began recording the data from the lobster trap IDâ€™s found on island cleanups to better understand the problem of trap loss in the region. On Hart Island, 223 lobster traps were collected which were stripped of tags. These tags are required to be on each and every trap fished and display the fishermans license number. The color of the tag correlates to the year it was deployed. 

The data collected on Hart Island can be helpful in identifying trends in lobster trap waste, and could be used to predict numbers in the future. Ideally, we could use this data in comparison with other Island's data to pinpoint concentration in lobster waste, and develope plans for waste prevention/mitigation.

We focused our data analysis on the agae of lobster traps in correlation to number of traps found, homeports of individual lobstermen in relation to number of traps, and depicting the weight and height total of lobster traps.

## Methods 


## Analysis 
By looking at the relationship between the number of lost lobster traps and the age of individual traps, our bar chart looked fairly linnear, as we found a positive correlation between age of traps and number of traps. The majority of abandoned lobster trabs found were around 1 year old, and the fewest lobster traps were around 9 years old. This suggests that most lobster traps in general do not last many years, as it gets increasingly more rare to find older traps. Taking the data on individual lobstermen, the homeports they came from, and the number of traps linked to the indivudls via trap ID, we created a graph showing the relationships between variables. We found that the majority of individuals were coming from Port Clyde. The bar chart shows a significant outlier in number of traps lost per individual, with a count of around 85 abandoned traps while the rest of the individuals were tied to under 30 traps. Using a leaflet map, we were able to visulize the number of traps in relation to the homeports they came from. Again, Port Clyde was the outlier with significantly more traps then the rest of the harbors. This makes sense because Hart Island is located off the coast of Port Clyde, so traps coming from Port Clyde would not have to travel far to wash up on Hart Island. Lastly, we looked at the total weight and height of abandoned lobster traps. To represent weight, we calculated total weight of traps, coming out to 8,920 pounds, and represented it by compairing the total weight to other objects. We used the same processes for total height of traps, calculating the height to be 223 feet.
